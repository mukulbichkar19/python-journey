############################## Looping in Python ##############################################
Python does not contain do-while loop, it only contains for loop and while loop.
while loop can be used for iterating over list, tuple and string
Since elements inside a set and dictionary (dict) cannot be accessed using indexes it's better to use for loop for
iterating over them.
for loop is used for iterating over string, list, tuple, set or dictionary
for loop needs range(start, stop, step) to go over indices
for getting the index of an item we use the enumerate() function
The range() built in function cannot be used to generate range in float.
